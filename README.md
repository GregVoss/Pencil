My Pencil Kata Test

For Kata test I did the Pencil Durability Kata, I made a Maven Project with Intellij and Java/Junit. 

You will need to have Maven installed in order to run this.

To run my project, pull the repository down locally and then navigate to the base folder (Where the Pom.xml) file is located. 

The tests can be run by typing in mvn -test.
